Workflow

Classes that has no attendnace will be marked as "Not Completed"
When starting class have 2 buttons to either use BLE Attendance or Direct QR Attendance

once teacher clicks finish Attendance it will push it to the database but attendance stays in progress

when time exceeds the time after the end time it will automatically close marked as "closed"

tables are going to be designed soon

after all of those the attendance should be able to be exported via xlsx

On The Student side, have a log of what classes they have attended via SQLite Log histroy
And if it just scanned the same session itll just say already scanned but also have a reset attendance or try again feature that will delete the log on their phone.
